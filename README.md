# reaper-scripts
Some scripts written in MoonScript for the Reaper DAW.
(with some Ruby and Bash for housekeeping) :)

To set up and deploy scripts:

1. `bundle install`
2. `bundle exec rake deploy`

You can also use guard to watch your moonscript files.

`bundle exec guard
`
It will deploy when it detects changes.
